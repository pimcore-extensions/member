# Frontend user extension for [pimcore](http://www.pimcore.org/)

**NOTE:** This extension is under development. **Some features are not working yet (see list below).**  
If you need frontend user in your project you can give it a try. But don't expect to much for now ;)  
Fork, hack & have fun! **Pull requests are more than welcome!** :)

## Roadmap

* ☑ Member accounts based on pimcore's data objects
* ☑ Register account (activation modes: auto, email, admin)
* ☑ Login (email/password), logout
* ☑ Reset password (confirm via email)
* ☑ Customizable and extensible flow by config and event hooks
* ☐ Social sign-in thanks to [HybridAuth](https://github.com/hybridauth/hybridauth)
* ☐ User roles
* ☐ Profile edit, password change
* ☐ Public member profile
* ☐ Remember me
* ☐ More docs
* ☐ First stable release & publish to packagist

### Some ideas for the future
* Login error log and anti brute force protection
* Registration only by invitation (invite by admin or active member)
* OpenID/OAuth provider
* Option to force password change after configured period
* Alternative password strength validator inspired by http://xkcd.com/936/ :)

## Documentation

### Controller helper

* Get current logged member object (null if not logged):  
    ```php
    $this->_helper->member()
    ```

* Force login in controller's action:
    ```php
    $this->_helper->member->requireAuth();
    ```
    This will automatically redirect user to configured login page.

### Event API

Events can be used to hook into many functionalities. For more information about using Event API
please check [pimcore documentation](https://www.pimcore.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=14551652).

* ```member.register.validate``` - allows to override validation of register form data.  
    Your callback must return configured instance of ```\Zend_Filter_Input```.  
    See ```\Member\Listener\Register::validate()``` for default implementation.
* ```member.register.post``` - allows to define what should be done after member object was created. 
    By default member object is published - which means that account is active and member
    is able to login.  
    There is also ```confirm``` callback implemented which sends confirmation link via email.  
    If you remove ```postRegister``` action from ```config.xml``` members must be activated by admin.
* ```member.password.reset``` - allows to override validation of password reset form data.  
    Your callback must return configured instance of ```\Zend_Filter_Input```.  
    See ```\Member\Listener\Password::reset()``` for default implementation.
    
### Email templates

Plugin installer will automatically create two email documents.
You should add appropriate action links with
[placeholders](https://www.pimcore.org/wiki/display/PIMCORE3/Placeholders) in content of those emails.
* ```member/emails/register-confirm```  
    ```%Text(host);/member/confirm?hash=%Object(member_id,{"method": "getConfirmHash"});```
* ```member/emails/password-reset```  
    ```%Text(host);/member/password-reset?hash=%Object(member_id,{"method": "getResetHash"});```
